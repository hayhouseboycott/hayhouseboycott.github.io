# FAQ
    ## I don’t agree with what you are doing/it’s lower energy/how dare you/etc.
        - We have no issues with Doreen’s spiritual path or choice of religion. This has nothing to do with Christianity. We have Christians who are also boycotting Hay House over these issues. The lady who started this website was raised Catholic. We have issues with censorship, lies and unfairness.
        - You’re fully entitled to your opinion, but you should be respectful to our right to free and open speech. This is a peaceful protest. People who act out in anger towards us will naturally display their true selves. We believe that those who are truly clairvoyant will see who is in the right in this situation and who is coming from a place of real truth and light. We’re doing this in a grounded and fair way, and we have explained our logical reasons for doing so. We would implore you to be informed before you lash out at anyone boycotting Hay House. Listen to your inner voice and ask what you feel is right. If you’re informed and you still don’t approve, just scroll on - as you know, this would actually be giving the boycott your energy, and if you are not interested in that, you should probably move on ;) 
    ## Selling Ascended Masters/Hay House decks/books for charity
        - Please see our [how to page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link news/howto.html %})!
    ## But I like my Ascended Masters deck and I want to keep it!
        - You can sell another DV deck with the same hashtag _#hayhouseboycott_, we’re just using the Ascended Masters deck as the main deck because DV asked us to get rid of it.
    ## How long will the boycott last?
        - As long as it takes to get what we expect as a result of the boycott.
    ## Why is Doreen not qualified to teach Fairyologist/Angelologist?
        - Fairyologist
            - Doreen can not pronounce Irish words such as [Tuatha Dé Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann) [^1].
            - Doreen says that you will be confronted with veganism if you start to work with fairies. This is not true for everyone and is incorrect information. [^2].
        - Angelologist
            - Please see [Lisa Eddy’s blog](http://angelorum.co/topics/reviews/theological-doctrine-of-angels-my-arse/) for more specific info on this. The course is supposed to be a theological course in a lecture style format but is of very poor quality.
    ## How can I help you further?
        - Report Hay House and Angel Therapy Inc. [to the BBB](https://www.bbb.org/sdoc/business-reviews/product-sales-general/hay-house-inc-in-carlsbad-ca-1038632).
        - Write a [complaint to Doreen Virtue](https://www.earthangel.com/contact/) and to [Hay House](https://www.hayhouse.com/contact/email/) about how you feel. Ask for a refund if you think you are entitled to one.
        - Share our posts, retweet us. Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Hay-House-Boycott-736282823236035/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hayhouseboycott).
        - Make unique tweets and comments about this subject. STAY GROUNDED. Please make sure you stick to facts and logical arguments if you can. The purpose of this is to show ourselves as a group of grounded and logical consumers of Hay House. We have good reasons for the boycott and we wish to stick to them. Link to the website and sources in the website to make your point. Be yourself and honest. It’s not rocket science ;)
        - Spread the word. Ask your local shop to stop stocking Hay House and explain to them why you will not be buying any more Hay House products.
        - Please make sure you use the hashtag #hayhouseboycott and make as many posts public about this subject as you feel comfortable with.
        - Share your unique story of how you were censored. If you share it with us we will share it for you. Ideally we would show your name and country, but we’ll share anonymous stories too. Non-anonymous stories have more impact.
        - Pleaes make sure you document everything. Hay House and Doreen Virtue have a tendancy to delete comments and complaints if they do not fit to their agenda.

[^1]: Please see Doreen's video #9 about "Celtic Fairies" as part of her Fairyologist course
[^2]: Please see Doreen's Fairyologist course. She advocates a raw vegan diet: ```You’ll probably notice this course affecting your appetite for foods and beverages, where you’re more drawn to healthier vegan and organic foods. When you spend time with fairies, they do help us to be more aligned with nature. So you no longer crave heavy foods, especially if they involved animal cruelty or pesticides.
The usual path of “appetite ascension” is to first lose your desire for “red meat” (cows and pigs), and next lose your appetite for chickens and turkeys. After this, the desire for cheese, dairy, and eggs goes away next. Then, the desire for processed or overly-cooked food is gone. Eventually, you only desire fresh organic fruits and vegetables. Some people believe that fruitarianism is the highest vibrational path of eating, since it doesn’t involve killing plants or animals. If you are guided to go vegan, be sure to take daily B-12 supplement, and do research about ways to get your protein needs met through kale, beans, legumes, and so forth.```
