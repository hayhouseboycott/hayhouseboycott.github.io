# What happened?
## Why all this?

### The story so far
  * Doreen posts a video [denouncing her works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzoATQ-dyo&feature=youtu.be&t=626
) and deletes it. She also talks about people in the New Age who are of "[lower energy](https://youtu.be/SSzoATQ-dyo?t=1410)".
  * Students [start asking questions on her pages and groups](thecelticfairy.com/2017/09/06/an-open-letter-to-doreen-virtue/) and they are immediately banned, without explanation (we know of at least 20).
  * [Maui video interview is released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzoATQ-dyo&feature=youtu.be&t=626) where Doreen further denounces her older works.
  * Doreen’s Hay House radio shows started playing repeats of her show shortly after the Maui video interview was released.
  * [Deleted video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzoATQ-dyo) where Doreen asks followers to get rid of the Ascended Masters deck resurfaces.
  * Doreen sends a “message of love” to her students where she says she is [concerned about their anger](https://youtu.be/jPFPfu_xCtw?t=496).
  * Doreen says [there are people of lower energy speaking out against her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1cKNAFw4nk&feature=youtu.be&t=760) and that they are writing mean letters to Hay House. Ursula asked Hay House if they were receiving mean emails but [they said they were not](https://twitter.com/tangentfairy/status/910089548809547776).
  * Video resurfaces of Doreen’s yearly card reading for 2017 where she [prophesies her students having an admirable uprising](https://youtu.be/ohbUOIH1MHk?t=511), and that people should hold a peaceful boycott of any companies that are not doing right.
  * Doreen said all the money from the eBay auctions and all of the money from her courses _did_ go to feed the animals [following the publication of this blog](http://www.thecelticfairy.com/2017/09/17/doreen-virtues-dream/). [But the key word here is that she says "that _month_" in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REYElIRhZpk&feature=youtu.be&t=1766). So we think it was only for one month that money went to the animals. This is strange because the eBay auctions went on for at least six months. The animal sanctuary is being dissolved and Doreen quotes ["selling everything and following Jesus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1cKNAFw4nk&feature=youtu.be&t=755).
  * Currently Doreen claims that there are [still people who have a problem with her path](https://www.facebook.com/DoreenVirtue444/videos/1759766487397988/), even though we have no problems with Jesus and some of us are Christians, and is playing the victim.
  * [Hay House are issuing refunds](http://angelorum.co/uncategorized/how-to-get-a-refund-for-your-doreen-virtue-course/) to anyone who wants a refund for their Doreen Virtue course. Doreen Virtue's own camp has only released two refunds. One to [Lisa Eddy with this note](https://twitter.com/LisaFrideborg/status/911986113413251072), and another to Ursula Clarke for the Fairyologist course. It is not known why Lisa and Ursula are deemed to be the only people who are deserving of a refund. Many people have asked for refunds.
  * Hay House US, UK and [Australia](https://www.facebook.com/HayHouseAust/videos/10154989614760308/?comment_id=10154997143130308&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D) are all censoring comments on their Facebook pages.
  * This is all very well summarised [on Lisa Eddy’s blog](http://angelorum.co/uncategorized/truth-doreen-virtues-conversion/)

### Where Doreen denounced her works
  * This video where she says to [get rid of the Ascended Masters deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzoATQ-dyo&feature=youtu.be&t=626). She says there are some gods/goddesses that she will not work with anymore
  * [This interview in Maui](https://youtu.be/0e8QYAWgJMo?t=733) which she also says Ascended Masters and tarot cards are gone. She says she will not be paid for the tarot decks.
  * In her latest book Father Therapy, it is said that [if you have a problem with "God" or "Jesus" then you have father issues](http://www.go.hayhouse.com/fathertherapy). It's assumed that worshipping Goddesses (like in Doreen's Goddess oracle deck) is now seen as demonic by Doreen.
  * The removal of [all but three angels from her website](https://www.angeltherapy.com/faq).
  * The same FAQ page quotes the bible passages where it says that divination is detestable to the lord.
  * Please note if you ask Doreen directly what she asks about specific Goddesses or Gods from her Ascended Masters and Goddess deck that she will not give you a clear answer.
    
## Where Doreen and her staff have been judgemental and marginalising
  * [The Archangel Michael page](https://www.angeltherapy.com/archangel-michael) on Doreen's website where it says "All holy angels are ranked and submit themselves to God’s authority, just as a wife is admonished to be submissive to her husband in 1 Corinthians 11:10. Submission here being an honor that gives power and strength; never taking it away."
  * Anybody who asks a question that Doreen does not like in the Fairyologist group is banned. [This started with Ursula](http://www.thecelticfairy.com/2017/09/06/an-open-letter-to-doreen-virtue/) and a few other pagan people and has extended to even the group admin of another Doreen Virtue group!
  * Doreen Virtue Facebook page. Every time somebody asks a discernable question they are banned.
  * There is a group that Doreen was in called the [New Age to Christianity Recovery Group where she has posted judgemental things].
  * Her staff
      * Andrew Karpenko has sent some very strange emails to Ursula which she will be publishing.
      * Sherry Wynn has blocked Doreen's students and blocked them from Doreen Virtue's pages without reason.
      * Reasons are not given when students are banned. Everyone who was in the Fairyologist group on Facebook paid for the course, and when they ask discernable questions they are banned.
      
## Censorship examples
  * Hay House
      * [Ursula Clarke was banned](http://www.thecelticfairy.com/2017/09/06/an-open-letter-to-doreen-virtue/) from the page for asking Doreen questions in the Fairyologist group (not comments made on the Hay House page). She was later unbanned and then banned again for making the following comments:
      * Lisa Eddy was banned for asking discernible comments on the Hay House page
      * TBA: Please send us your specific example/screenshot
  * Doreen Virtue
      * Ursula Clarke who was banned for (we believe, asking about goddesses and witches):
      * Lisa Eddy who was banned for asking discernible questions:
      * TBA: Please send us your specific example/screenshot
  * Teal Swan
      * [Teal, another Hay House author, posted this video recently](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaUO7-WgT4D/?hl=en&taken-by=tealspiritualcatalyst) where she is happy that people came away feeling "suicidal" from her workshop. She banned anyone asking questions about it.

## Avoiding censorship
  * Tweets cannot be deleted.
  * Be persistent. You can ignore one person but not an army of truthers!
