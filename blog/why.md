# Why are we doing this?

## Censorship
  * Hay House and Doreen Virtue [censor anyone who questions them on their pages](https://hayhouseboycott.github.io/faq.html), even when done so in a logical and grounded manner. We believe in a free and open Internet. We believe in free speech, and especially peaceful free speech!
  ## Inadequate customer service
  * Doreen Virtue’s camp refuses to reply to most emails for refund requests, and sometimes even send out rude emails.
  * Hay House refuse to answer our questions.
  
[Please see FAQ page for more defailed info.](https://hayhouseboycott.github.io/faq.html)

# What do we expect as a result of the boycott?

## From Hay House
  * Stop publishing Doreen Virtue and Teal Swan books. These “teachers” are not qualified to offer advice, and are actually a danger to their followers and their mental health!
  * Respect for open speech. Let us have a discussion with you. Let people vent on your page. Respond in a grounded and fair fashion. Show us that you can be different. Show us that you can be fair!
  * Improvements to customer service. Please respond to our questions publicly and via email. 
## From Doreen
  * Refunds for courses where students believe they are due them. 
  * Stop selling courses you are not qualified for. 
  * Respect for other religions and ways of spirituality. There is room for all faiths on earth, and all faiths can come from a peaceful and loving place, ours and yours.
  * Improvements to customer service. Please respond to our questions and be polite in your emails.
  * A public apology by name to Ursula, Lisa, and any of her other students whom she has disrespected.
  * From Teal Swan
  * Stop encouraging suicidal behaviour
  * Cease teaching and giving out mental health advice as she is not qualified
